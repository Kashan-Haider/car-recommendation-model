                Parse the query to extract all essential details such as:
                    Car Make/Model/Year (e.g., "Honda Civic 2012")
                    Location (e.g., "Lahore, Punjab")
                    Color Requirements (e.g., "white")
                    Engine Type (e.g., "Petrol")
                    Transmission (e.g., "Manual" or "Automatic")
                    Mileage (e.g., "around 33,000 km")
                    Body Type (e.g., "Sedan")
                    Features (e.g., "AM/FM Radio, Alloy Rims, Air Bags, Power Steering")
                    Price Range/Conditions (e.g., "Negotiable" or specific amount)

            Evaluate the Provided Content:
                Review each car record from the provided content. Each record contains detailed information such as car model, year, location, engine type, mileage, features, price, and more.
                Compare the details in each record with the user's query:
                    Exact and Partial Matches: Identify which records meet or closely align with the specifications.
                    Relevance Ranking: Rank the records based on how well they match the user's criteria.
                    Top 5 Selection: Choose the top 5 records that best satisfy the user's requirements.

            Generate the Final Response:
                If at least one matching record is found, return a formatted list of the top 5 best car recommendations.
                Each recommendation should include all relevant details: Car Make/Model, Year, Location, Color, Engine Type, Transmission, Mileage, Body Type, Features, and Price.
                Use clear bullet points or numbered lists for readability.
                Include a brief summary of why each car is recommended relative to the query.
                Important: If no records in the provided content match the user's query, then return only the message:
                "NOTHING"

            Formatting Requirements:
                Return the answer as a very well-structured list.
                Ensure that the response is clear, structured, and professional.
                Use markdown formatting including headers, bold text, and lists.
